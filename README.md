A retro styled snake game made with Raylib and C++, hence the name Cnake. 

The snake uses  a deque datastructure to pop and add segment for its functionality

Overall a solid game made in less than 2 hours (Out of which most were spent for silly reasons, learning raylib functions , return types , etc..)

All the assets are made on my own with the greatest tool in human kind ( MS Paint ).
